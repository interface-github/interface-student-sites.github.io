<p>Back in the time Jasmine Harris was little her father gave her some beer she looked confused and didnt the know the meaning of drinking
so jasmine harris was a loyal little girl when was young she didnt really care other people thought of her a little bit she just kept getting
her grades up.And so by the time she went to highschool everything started to change in her life like all the bad she had done in the past
has came back but instead of just drinking it was drinking, smoking, and parties by the time she went to high school. But she still kept up
her grades up in the mid higher but i think that instead of drinking, smoking, and going to you should be your self and dont drink unless you
  want to in your future and so that for now about Jasmine Harris.</p>
<ul>
<li>the first thing i learn about Jasmine Harris is to dont drink drive with a kid</li>
<li>the second thing i learn about Jasmine Harris is to dont just keep going to parties without getting your grades up</li>
<li>the third thing i learn about Jasmine Harris is to always give or get a second chance</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How I'm going to use what I learned today</h3>
<p>im going to use all of this information in the future because i dont want to under up in a bad area. how im going to do this is, is by dont just keep going to parties and be yourself and dont believe and other say, always think
positive and not negative. And i will always make sure everyone should get a second chance</p>
