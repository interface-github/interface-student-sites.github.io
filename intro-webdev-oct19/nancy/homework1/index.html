<p>What I want to become good at</p>
<p>In this paragraph, I want you to describe the things you want to be good at and what you think you need in order to achieve the goal. Put each item on a separate line. Also, add a class in front of each short description called “dreams”. An example:
	I want to be good at the following:<br />
<div class=”dreams” >Pranic Healer</div> I would love to become a better Pranic Healer.<br />
<div class=”dreams” >Coding.</div> I would love to learn more about coding and how to improve creating websites.<br />
<div class=”dreams” >Giving Back</div> I would love to become better at giving back to the community. <br />
<div class=”dreams” >Exercising.</div>I would love to add exercise and eating healthy foods to my daily life., (Which I am currently doing neither.)<br />
